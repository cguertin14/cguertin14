### Hi there, fellow SREs/SWEs/etc. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Charles, I'm from Montreal and I'm a team player. Currently, I'm studying Software Engineering as an undergraduate student. Here, I mostly work on personal and open sourced projects where I get to try new technologies and build `Cloud`-related stuff.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal and open sourced projects that use technologies and concepts such as:
- `Terraform`;
- `Kubernetes`;
- `Golang`;
- `CI/CD`.

Hence, you could say that I'm aiming to be another SRE, which is my primary reading interest these days. I also love to read about history.
My philosophy goes like this: Never stop learning, automate everything you can and keep things simple.
